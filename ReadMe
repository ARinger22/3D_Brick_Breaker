# 3D Brick Breaker Style Ball Game with Paddle

## Description
This is a 3D version of a classic brick breaker game implemented using PyOpenGL. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of a cube to bounce a ball, trying to keep it in play as long as possible. The game features physics-based ball movement, collision detection, and a scoring system.

## Features

3D environment with perspective camera
Realistic ball physics with bouncing mechanics
Player-controlled paddle to keep the ball in play
Score tracking system (1 point per wall hit)
Game over detection when ball misses the paddle
Visual feedback on collisions
Restart functionality

## Controls

W: Move paddle left
S: Move paddle right
A: Move paddle forward
D: Move paddle backward
R: Restart game (after game over)

## Requirements

Python 3.x
PyOpenGL
PyOpenGL_accelerate
GLUT (freeglut on Windows)

pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate

## How to Play

Run the script:
python 3d_brick_breaker.py
Use the controls to move the paddle and keep the ball in play

Try to score as many points as possible by bouncing the ball off the walls
The game ends when the ball hits the bottom surface without hitting your paddle
Press 'R' to restart after game over

## Scoring

+1 point for each wall hit (top, sides, front, back)
No points for bouncing off the paddle
The game ends when you miss the ball with the paddle
